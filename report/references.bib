Hayek’s theory of complex phenomena in this context and discuss the apparent implication that economic complexity prevents us from eliminating literary methods from economic science. If literary methods are a necessary part of economic science, then the highest level of mathematical rigor may not ensure high quality analysis if the literary methods we use are not equally rigorous. Hayek seems to point to a literary tradition in social science that may have established informative standards of rigor for the literary parts of economic science.},

  abstract = {Two network measures known as the economic complexity index (ECI) and product complexity index (PCI) have provided important insights into patterns of economic development. We show that the ECI and PCI are equivalent to a spectral clustering algorithm that partitions a similarity graph into two parts. The measures are also closely related to various dimensionality reduction methods, such as diffusion maps and correspondence analysis. Our results shed new light on the ECI’s empirical success in explaining cross-country differences in gross domestic product per capita and economic growth, which is often linked to the diversity of country export baskets. In fact, countries with high (low) ECI tend to specialize in high-PCI (low-PCI) products. We also find that the ECI and PCI uncover specialization patterns across U.S. states and U.K. regions.},

Concerning the product categories and their complexity, the most complex products consist of machinery, chemicals and metal products. The main exporters of the most complex products are developed countries. This means that the countries have high export competitiveness. Considering the share of high-tech exports, it is seemed that Turkey is below the level it should be. This causes relatively low index of economic complexity and low export competitiveness of Turkey.},

For most of them, different calculations of "intra-national distances" are also available. The GeoDist webpage provides two distinct files: a country-specific one (geo\_cepii) and a dyadic one (dist\_cepii) including the set of different distance and common dummy variables used in gravity equations to identify particular links between countries such as colonial past, common languages, contiguity. We try to improve upon the existing similar datasets in terms of geographical coverage, measurement and number of vari-ables provided.},
